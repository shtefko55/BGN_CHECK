# PaddleOCR Configuration
# This app uses a self-hosted PaddleOCR server for text recognition
# 
# SETUP:
# The app is configured to use a PaddleOCR server hosted at:
# - API Endpoint: http://69.62.115.146:8868/predict/ocr_system
# - Health Check: http://69.62.115.146:8868/
#
# No API key is required for the self-hosted PaddleOCR service.
# The service provides unlimited requests and full data control.
#
# If you want to host your own PaddleOCR server, you can:
# 1. Set up PaddleOCR on your own VPS
# 2. Update the API endpoints in utils/ocrService.ts
# 3. Configure your server to accept image data in base64 format

# Optional: Add other environment variables here
